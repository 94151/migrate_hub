          <p>We are not immigration consultants; in fact it has been on record millions of times that we provide secretarial services for any types of visas including the Canadian Visas. It's just like the MARA for Australia and OISC in UK, which clearly state that getting recognized by these counsels do not guarantee a VISA or have an edge on others but these are people who registered with the counsels and should abide by the do and don't which we here at Migrate Hub follow very closely. On a personal note, we have seen that companies or individuals do it because it gives them an opportunity to charge client 3-5 times more than the normal market price, as they flaunt this recognition. On the other hand, we momentarily agree that having one would give more authentication to a entity but we here at Migrate Hub decided to give it a miss because we are not migration experts we are visa experts in which migration is a part and we believe in success in numbers and can assure you that we, at any given point of time can challenge that any consultant in the world wouldn't have as many success as we have. We here at Migrate Hub have created history and will keep doing it with our dedicated VISA SECRETARIAL SERVICES.

                    <p>No. If you want to work in the US, get a visa for the US. Canadian PR will not help except as a backup in case the work visa in the US is not renewed, moving to Canada could be a better option to him rather than going home. Still, using Canadian PR as a backup is also dependent on not being away from Canada too long because then he will lose the PR he'd already have waited for and paid money to get. As for getting Canadian citizenship, that's at least a 4 year process after getting PR so it's a question if he's ready to do that just for the right to be able to get a NAFTA visa to the US if his profession qualifies him for that.

                    <p>The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) created special economic and trade relationships for the United States, Canada and Mexico. The TN nonimmigrant classification permits qualified Canadian and Mexican citizens to seek temporary entry into the United States to engage in business activities at a professional level. Among the types of professionals who are eligible to seek admission as TN nonimmigrants are accountants, engineers, lawyers, pharmacists, scientists, and teachers. You may be eligible for TN nonimmigrant status, if: � You are a citizen of Canada or Mexico; �  Your profession qualifies under the regulations; �  The position in the United States requires a NAFTA professional; �  You have a prearranged full-time or part-time job with a U.S. employer (but not self-employment - see documentation required below); and �  You have the qualifications to practice in the profession in question. Eligibility Criteria Unlike Mexican citizens, Canadian citizens are generally eligible for admission as nonimmigrants without a visa. The TN category, a nonimmigrant classification, simply reflects this general exemption from the visa requirement. NAFTA governs which evidence is required to prove whether a Canadian or Mexican citizen is a professional in a qualifying profession. Canadian Citizens If you are a Canadian citizen, then you are not required to apply for a TN visa at a U.S. consulate. You may establish eligibility for TN classification at the time you seek admission to the United States by presenting required documentation to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer at certain CBP-designated U.S. ports of entry or at a designated pre-clearance/pre-flight inspection station.
