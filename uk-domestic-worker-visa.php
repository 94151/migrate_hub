                    <p>You can bring your family members (known as 'dependants') to the UK if you are in the UK or planning to come to the UK as a domestic worker.<br>

Your dependants are your husband, wife, civil partner, same-sex partner or unmarried partner, and your children aged under 18.<br>

You dependents will have permission to stayin UK for the same length of time as you have. They will be able to work while they are in the UK, but their employment must not be necessary to support you or any other dependant.<br>

<strong>If your dependants are outside the UK</strong><br>
Your dependants can apply to come with you to the UK or join you in UK.

<strong>If your dependants are inside the UK</strong><br>
If you apply to extend your stay in the UK, your dependants can also apply to extend their stay.

<strong>Can my dependants apply in their own right?</strong><br>
If they want to, your dependants can apply for permission in their own right (not as your dependants). They will need to meet the requirements of the immigration categories under which they are applying.<br>
