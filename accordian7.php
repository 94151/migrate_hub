                    <p>PCC � Police clearance certificate is asked by immigration authority to determine whether you are of good character. Immigration authority can ask for police certificates for each country you have lived in for 12 months or more over the last ten (10) years since turning 16.

A person will not pass the character test where: �  If you have a substantial criminal record � If you have been convicted of any offence that was committed while in immigration detention, during an escape from immigration detention, during a period where a person escaped from immigration detention, or if the person has been convicted of the offence of escaping from immigration detention �  If you have or had an association with an individual, group or organisation suspected of having been, or being, involved in criminal conduct �  If on review of past and present criminal conduct, the person is found not to be of good character �  If on assessment of past and present general conduct, the person is found to be not of good character � If the Immigration authority find that the person can be a significant risk to country�s safety and may engage in criminal conduct in Country, harass, molest, intimidate or in stalking etc.
