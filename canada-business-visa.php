Canada Business Visas are easily granted for applicants who prove they have genuine business intent & the finances to support themselves in the country they are visiting.

More often than not, an assessment is based on documents submitted & the visa interviews are rare.

Business Visa is granted for three to six months for first time applicants, those who have visited before can apply for 1, 2, 5 or 10 years depending on your profile.

Canada does not require the applicant to attend a personal interview; decisions are mostly made on the basis of your documents. Chances of having to attend a personal interview are rare. If your application is successful, the visa is stamped on the passport and sent by mail.</p>
