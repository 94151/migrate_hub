                    <h3>Country Profile</h3>
                    <p>Australia derived from Latin means south. It is also referred by some as Southern land of Holy Spirit. It is a land of varied landscape and weather.<br>

Australia is a wealthy country, with high GDP per capita and low poverty. It is ranked third in index of economic freedom. The country is ranked second in United Nation Human Development index.<br>

Education is compulsory throughout Australia. Literacy rate is 99%. Australia has 37 government funded universities and two private universities.<br>

Health in Australia is given high importance. Australia stands forth in highest life expectancy in the world â€“ 79.5 years for males and 84 years for females. Total expenditure on health is 90% of GDP. It is nominally funded by income tax surcharge, known as Medicare levy.<br>

The major concern of Australia is scarcity of skilled persons. What Australia looks for is skilled and talented professionals, and has amended its migration policy to fulfill the skill shortage in the country.
