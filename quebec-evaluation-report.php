                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Quebec Skilled Worker Visa is a point based system and judges an applicant on criteria like

<li>Age</li>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Job offer</li>
<li>Language ability</li><br>
The points for each parameter differ and the eligibility for each parameter is measured differently. Hence a very thorough and intense study is required to check whether you score the required points or not.</p>

                     For knowing whether you score the required points, Evaluation is the best and most readily available option. Signing up for a Canada Evaluation will authorise a team of our expert consultants to review your profile and check your eligibility for the visa. If you are eligible then you can take the next step of registering for our full service and applying for the visa. But in case you don’t meet the eligibility criteria, your case will not be considered for that particular visa.</p>

              Evaluation is necessary and suggested because immigration to a foreign country involves putting at stake your money and valuable time. Visa to any country cannot be guaranteed hence one should be careful before investing one’s resources in this field. Our Evaluation report will act as a preliminary checklist for taking your decision that whether or not to go in for an immigration process of a country.<br>

Hence it’s wise to first take our Evaluation and then decide upon a particular visa.
