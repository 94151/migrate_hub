                    <p>As per CIC, the time for an application processing for permanent residence varies from between 6 months and 10 months, in some case it may also exceed the time. It depends on the immigration Officer. There are many factors that influence the processing time of the application such as immigration office where the application is submitted, category of visa, supporting documents, verification, assessing the need for a personal interview, evaluating the demographics of the applicants. All these factors influence the processing time of the application. If, all documents are submitted as per requirement, then it takes less time to process an application.</p>
