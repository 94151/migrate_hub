                    <p>Australian organisations (businesses, communities or government agencies) can sponsor overseas doctors to work in Australia for up to 4 years.<br>

Temporary visas are the usual pathway to permanent residence for doctors who do not yet hold full medical registration in Australia. Overseas trained doctors can commence a period of supervised practice and formal assessment in Australia to meet the requirements for full medical registration.<br>

<b>1.Temporary Business (Long Stay) (Subclass 457) Visa</b><br>

<b>2.Occupational Trainee visa</b><br>

Some doctors coming to Australia to undertake a supervised training program may be able to apply for an Occupational Trainee visa for up to 12 months. The doctor must be appointed to a designated training position that is not primarily service-providing in nature. Organisations providing occupational training programs must apply to nominate doctors for this visa.</p>

                    <p>Foreign applicants have to get their skills assessed by Australian Medical Council.<br>

Australian Medical Council Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) MCQ (Multiple Choice Questions) Examination assesses your knowledge.<br>

The AMC Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) MCQ Examination is a computer-administered fully integrated multi-choice question examination delivered in one 3.5 hour session in examination centres worldwide.<br>

The examination consists of 150 A-type MCQs (one correct response from five options)—120 scored items and 30 (non-scored) pilot items. You are expected to complete all 150 items and must complete the 120 scored items. Failure to complete all 120 scored items in the examination may lead to insufficient information for a reliable determination of your ability and therefore a result on the AMC adaptive scale. The examination result is recorded as ‘Fail—Insufficient data to obtain result’.<br>

                    <h3>FAQ</h3>
                    <p><b>Can the Doctors or Nurses work in Australia with an Foreign Degree ?</b><br>
Doctors who wish to practice in Australia must first be registered with the Medical Board in the State or Territory where they intend to practice. Doctors can apply for either a temporary or permanent visa. For immigration purposes, doctors seeking permanent residency in Australia must hold full medical registration. After the visa is granted, doctors must apply to Medicare Australia for a Medicare Provider Number if they will be working in general practice or will be prescribing drugs.
