                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The explanation of dependent in the immigration rules that apply to students are:

                     <li> A married partner (spouse)</li>
                     <li> A civil partner </li>
                      <li>Any dependent children under the age of 18</li></p>
                      <p>This means that bachelors are not considered dependents and are not eligible to apply for entry to the United Kingdom as a student dependent.<br>

                      Note also that parents and other family members are not considered dependents in the immigration rules for students and are also not eligible to accompany a student as a dependent.</p>

                    <h3>Requirements</h3>
                     <p>
                      If you wish to join your spouse/civil partner and/or dependent children to the United Kingdom with you, it is best if they apply for a visa at the same time as you.<br>

                      <li>Their application form should make clear that they are accompanying you and that you will be here as a student.</li>
                      <li>If they do not apply at the same time as you, they should make sure that they include in their application a copy of your passport identity page, a copy of your United Kingdom student visa and if possible, a letter from the University confirming your status here (this letter can be obtained from the Undergraduate Office or Graduate Schools Office).</li>
                      <li>Again, their application form should state clearly that they are accompanying you and that you will be here as a student. In all cases, they should check before arriving in the UK that their visa gives them dependent status. If a mistake is made and they arrive in the UK with visitor status, it is difficult to correct this error in the UK.</li><br>
                      You will need to show that you can accommodate and sustain yourself and your dependents without recourse to public funds and without relying on any potential future income in the UK, as this income is not guaranteed.

                    <h3>Work Permit With Student Dependent Visa</h3>
                    <p>Once the family members are granted permission to come to and stay in the UK, their passport or Biometric Residence Permit will state their work conditions.<br>

                      If it says nothing about work, this means they can work without restriction. They can work full-time or part-time and they can be self-employed or employed<br>
                       If the passport says "No work" or "Work prohibited" then in these case family member cannot take work
