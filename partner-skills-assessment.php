                    <p>An applicant can claim 'partner skills' points if the partner is also able to satisfy the basic requirements of age, English language ability, has nominated an occupation on the same Skilled Occupation List (SOL) as the primary applicant for which they have obtained a suitable skills assessment from the relevant assessing authority and they meet the Australian study requirement or have recent work experience in a skilled occupation which is on the SOL as the primary applicant.

Important: You cannot claim 'partner skills' points if your partner is an Australian permanent resident or an Australian citizen or if they are not included in your visa application.</p>
