                  <p>The process at Migrate Hub is smooth, transparent and extremely well organized. I got the visa much earlier than the expected date, without many hurdles as the documentation and the multi stage review system at Migrate Hub has been close to perfection. They have sound knowledge on the process, documentation backed up by well organized web portal and information sharing mechanism. Their communication, minuting every conversation and timely response for any query is outstanding. Also, as I kept travelling across countries for work during the process, I am glad that they were proactive to call my different mobile numbers to guide me on the further process. The key success parameters for visa grant are: Preparing the documents much in advance based on planned migration date, having patience for document review, genuineness in documentation, flexibility in changing the document contents based on the feedback and pro-activeness in responding to the queries by immigration officials and consultant. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the service quality of Migrate Hub and ready to refer it to my friends and family members.</p>

                  <p>I would like to thank Migrate Hub and Mrs.Ashwini Naga & the team for helping me in fulfilling my dream of getting Canada PR. They know what, when and how to do the things to reach to the final destination.Ashwini Naga had provided very detailed information and guidance at each step of the process. Their expertise and experience has always given me confidence and encouraged me to proceed further even when it was looking difficult and more on that the final satage of visa has just completed in 2 months exactly in our(me and my wife) case.I would say they are the best for Canada immigration with very high success rate. Special thanks to Ashwini Naga</p>
