                     A person can migrate as a spouse if he/she is married to their sponsor and the marriage is officially valid.

If a person has married in Canada, they should provide a marriage certificate issued by the province where the marriage took place.

If a person has married outside Canada, then the marriage must be valid under the law of the country where it occurred and under Canadian law. Marriages that happen in an embassy or consulate should be in accordance with the law of the country where it took place, not the country of citizenship of the embassy or consulate.
