                      <li><b>Sponsorship from approved education provider</b><br>
                      30 points will be granted if the student obtains an offer from a college or university eligible to sponsor. University and colleges should obtain a license to teach international students in the UK. Students should check if the college is on the Tier 4 register of sponsors to earn points.<br>
                      An offer letter also known as a visa letter is issued by the college/university sponsoring you, with information about you, your sponsor, the course, and your finances.</li><br>

                       <li><b
                       >Maintenance Funds</b><br>
