                  <p>Firstly I would like to mention about Manoj who had been working on my case , he has been outstanding in his support,He had been very helpful and very prompt,His suggestions were very helpful.Sometimes he has suggested approach based on my personal situation which was quite helpful. Migrate Hub internal processes like direct call connection to case officer , review process of documents has been very impressive.Although it was time consuming it was worth the process,I have been recommending Migrate Hub to my friends and Relatives who were trying migration.Some friends backed out due to cost but its still worth due to the quality involved. One point I missed was the constant follow-up which I liked as it was helpful reminder.</p>
