                    <p>Those who are educated, competent, have skills that are in demand, can get well into a new environment and have the ability to make immediate economic contribution to the state of Quebec can apply for Canadian permanent residency through Quebec Selected Skilled Workers Program.<br>

                    Like the Federal Skilled Worker Visa, the Quebec – Selected Skilled Worker program is an alternate point based immigration route to Canada. This route is intended as a permanent Canadian visa for immigration.<br>

                    Quebec skilled worker visa for Canada gives unrestricted access to the domestic job market without the need for a Canadian work permit, a sponsoring employer, or a specific job offer.<br>

                    You must be conversant in these languages – English and French.<br>

                    You will need to prove you can support yourself & your family in Quebec.<br>

             <li>The country's rapidly ageing population, coupled with a dearth of young workers, will cause a major shortage of potential employees and could mean immigrants will account for almost all of the labour force growth within a decade, Statistics Canada suggests</li>
             <li>Census data for 2002, predicts potential worker shortfalls in a vast range of occupations by 2011, from family doctors to bricklayers</li>
             <li>In 2002, Quebec accepted approximately 21,600 Skilled Workers applicants and approximately 3,000 Business applicants</li>
